## Introduction
The **Municipal Service Reporting System** is a C# .NET Framework Windows application that allows residents to report municipal issues, such as potholes, water leaks, and power outages. The system features file attachment, progress tracking, and issue status updates. A local SQL Server database is used to manage reported issues (The IIE, 2024).

This document provides instructions on how to set up, compile, run, and use the application.
